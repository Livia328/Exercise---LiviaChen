## Part I: Math
### Question:
>Consider the following problem:
>
>             (a) Min Z = –3X1 + X2
>
>Subject to the following:
>
>             (b) X1 + X2 ≤ 5
>
>             (c) 2X1 + X2 ≤ 8  
>
>             (d) X1 ≥ 0, X2 ≥ 0 
>
>What is the optimal solution?
### Solution:
In this problem, I will use graphical method to achieve. 
  
First, we could plotting the region satisfies all the constraints.
  
We could change equation (a) to this format:
  
  
             Z = -3X1 + X2 
          -> X2 = 3X1 + Z
  
The coefficient of this equation is 3 and the intersection of this function and the X2-axis is the value of Z.
